This mod is for Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous, it contains a number of changes for the Demon mythic path to make it a more interesting and better "feeling" mythic path, while still trying to keep it within the vision of the game. It contains a number of bug-fixes, new abilities, and a different way of handling the Demon's main mechanic: Rage.
