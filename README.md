# PATH OF RAGE

This mod is for Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous, it contains a number of changes for the Demon mythic path to make it a more interesting and better "feeling" mythic path, while still trying to keep it within the vision of the game. It contains a number of bug-fixes, new abilities, and a different way of handling the Demon's main mechanic: Rage. 

## How to Install

```
1. Download and install Unity Mod Manager, make sure it is at least version 0.23.0
2. Run Unity Mod Manger and set it up to find Wrath of the Righteous
3. Download the WOTR_PATH_OF_RAGE mod
4. Install the mod by dragging the zip file from step 3 into the Unity Mod Manager window under the Mods tab
```
## Changes
```
* Includes a number of changes to Demon Rage. This is now a toggleable ability that will consume a number of rounds instead of per-combat and a new icon is added.
* When you gain your Demon path, new special abilites called Demonologies are unlocked, allowing more rounds of rage per day.
* Brimorak Aspect uses a new component to fix its expected scaling
* Succubus Aspect now properly gives a malus to Attack Bonus instead of AC
* Kalvakus Aspect's bonus attack will only work while you have a melee weapon.
* Shadow Demon Aspect will no longer give double the wisdom bonus when toggled.
* Adds new icons to each aspect making it easier to tell them apart.
* Demon Lord Aspects are written to be given one at 9 and another at 10. This fixes that.
* Allows you to toggle Barbarian and Bloodrager rages while in a demon rage.
* Abyssal Storm no longer hurts the caster.
* Blood Haze now gives a +2 profane bonus to attack.
* At Mythic Rank 4 you gain an ability to use Demonic Charge that isn't a teleport. This is for instances where you can't use Demonic Charge
